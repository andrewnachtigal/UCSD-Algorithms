### Greedy Algorithms

Greedy algorithm follows the problem solving heuristic of making the locally
optimal choice at each stage with the intent of finding a global optimum.

Greedy algorithms are similar to dynamic programming algorithms in that the
solutions are both efficient and optimal if the problem exhibits some particular
sort of substructure.
