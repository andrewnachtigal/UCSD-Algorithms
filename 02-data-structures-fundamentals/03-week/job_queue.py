'''Parallel Processing

Parallelism is the process of processing several set of instructions
simultaneously. It reduces the total computational time.

Simulate a program that processes a list of jobs in parallel. Given a list of
ùëõ independent threads and ùëö jobs, threads take jobs in order.

Determine for each job which thread will process it and when will it start
processing. Apply a priority queue to simulate prcessing of thread events at
the start and completion of a job.
