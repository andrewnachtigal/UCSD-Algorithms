### Learning Goals

>
* Algorithmic techniques and application to solve algorithmic problems
* Implement programs that work in less than one second even on massive datasets
* Test and debug code without foreknowledge of test input
* Formulate real life computational problems as rigorous algorithmic problems
* Prove correctness of an algorithm and analyze its running time
