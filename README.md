## Learning Goals

* Understand essential algorithmic techniques and apply them to solve algorithmic problems
* Implement programs that work in less than one second even on massive datasets
* Test and debug your code even without knowing the input on which it fails
* Formulate real life computational problems as rigorous algorithmic problems
* Prove correctness of an algorithm and analyze its running time
