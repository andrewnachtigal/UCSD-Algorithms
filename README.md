# UC San Diego
MicroMasters Program in Algorithms &amp; Data Structures


## Learning Goals
1. Algorithmic techniques and application to solve algorithmic problems
2. Implement programs that work in less than one second even on massive datasets
3. Test and debug code without foreknowledge of test input
4. Formulate real life computational problems as rigorous algorithmic problems
5. Prove correctness of an algorithm and analyze its running time
